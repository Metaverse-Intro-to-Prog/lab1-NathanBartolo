Start with the list you used in Exercise 1, but instead of just

printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be

personalized with the person’s name.

"""

names =  ["ankol","kenlee","nayumi"]


print("Hello, my good friend {}".format(names[0]))
print("Hello, my good friend {}".format(names[1]))
print("Hello, my good friend {}".format(names[2]))
